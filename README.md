# Vite-module-federation-with-vue

## Project Setup
In each folder run:

```sh
npm install
```

Then for each of the folders `vue-module-a`, `vue-module-b` and `vue-module-c`, open a new terminal and run:

```sh
npm run build
```

After each build is created, you can server each module with the command:

```sh
npm run preview
```

Finally launch the app `vue-host` in a new terminal with: 

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` and test the application.
